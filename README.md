# Mineself

A service for deeply self-designed GTD and self time calculation workflow. Developed by Chenhao Wei.

## Plan
Three Main Parts:
* service part for ML give advice.
* iOS part for virsualization and data collection.
* Web part for cross platform service and will try to build a set of api.

For ML part I choose classic ML algo as the start, and next step will try RL alfo, such as TRPO.
For iOS part I choose Swift4 to build it with basic Core-ML feature runing localy.
For Web part I choose flask as the basic framework.

All three parts will be using the same database.
